Android Studio 

The PaAS platform which lets u build an android based application without stressing more.
I found it really easy to work in android studio. 

Today, we are gonna cover about the android studio "Recycler view"

As we need to display a lot of data in an application the recyclerview is added

Without affecting the main thread the multiple task can be performed;;


ListView can be used if u have smaller datasets




Stpes:: 

create a project

adding dependencies for cardview and recycle view  to avoid large size of android studio
has separated its features.



Now Create a RecyclerView inside ur desired  file

add next layout for card view
